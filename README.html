<p>Syng is a webbased karaoke client written in Python. It manages a playlist and forwards the top element of playlist to a configurable media player. Songs can be played from a library or from youtube. Once the software is started, it listens for a HTTP connection (Default on Port 1337) for control. Clients can connect via a web interface and search and add songs, which are played on the server.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Install with:</p>
<pre><code>pip install git+https://git.k-fortytwo.de/christofsteel/syng</code></pre>
<p>It needs at least Python34.</p>
<h2 id="first-run">First run</h2>
<p>Launch it with:</p>
<pre><code>syng</code></pre>
<p>At first launch, syng will create a configuration file at <code>${HOME}/.config/syng/syng.config</code>. Syng will look for cdg and mkv files in the folder <code>${HOME}/.local/share/syng/songs</code>. If you need to have your files in a different location, you can exit the software and edit the configuration file. Launch it again with the option <code>--scan</code> to start scanning for new files.</p>
<p>Syng will now start a webserver on <a href="http://localhost:1337" class="uri">http://localhost:1337</a></p>
<h2 id="administration">Administration</h2>
<p>You can set a password for an admin user in the configuration file. The admin interface is reachable under <a href="http://localhost:1337/admin" class="uri">http://localhost:1337/admin</a> . Username is <code>admin</code> and the default password is also <code>admin</code>. In the admin interface you can modify the playlist and skip songs.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-interface">Command line interface</h2>
<p>There is also a command line interface, mainly for testing purposes. See <code>syng_cli --help</code> for help.</p>
